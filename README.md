##Usage

1. MCCVRsolver: perform MCCVR with a set of fixed tuning parameters.
2. MCCVR: perform MCCVR for several sets of covariates and a four-class response, with regularization and weight parameters tuned by cross validation.
3. example: provide one example of MCCVR on extracting canonical variates based on simulated dataset.
